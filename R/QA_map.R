#' A research program (MABDE) was set up to investigate patterns of
#'adaptation in barley. In this project a large set of barley genotypes
#'(~190 genotypes) were evaluated in Europe and in the Mediterranean region.
#'More details about this population and research can be found
#'in Comadran et al. (2009).
#'In this example we use the information in one of those environments,
#'for a set of 179 genotypes. The population was genotyped by DArTs.
#'
#' @format A data frame 811 row (markers) and 3 column.
#' Column 1 gives the marker names,
#' column 2 the chromosome on which the marker has been mapped,
#' and column 3 indicates the position of the marker within the chromosome.
